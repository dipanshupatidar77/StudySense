 🔐 The Confidential Email
You receive an internal email by mistake. It talks about upcoming layoffs in your department. Some of your close colleagues are at risk, but management hasn’t announced anything yet. Sharing the info might cause panic. Keeping quiet feels unfair.
Reflective Question: Should you act in the team’s interest or follow protocol? What would you expect if the roles were reversed?
